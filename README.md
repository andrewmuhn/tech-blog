## Description

- The goal of this app is to have an easy to use CLI for a company to manage their employees, departments and roles.
- The personal goal with creating this application was to gain fluency with SQL servers, specifically mySQL and interacting with them via a node server.
- I gained a better understanding of why there is a need for return a promise in asynchronous code through creating a more modular design to my file structure.
