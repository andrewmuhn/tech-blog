## Description

- The goal of this app is to have an easy to use UI for users to write content about anything tech.
- The personal goal with creating this application was to gain fluency with the MVC paradigm.
- Through this processs I gained a functional understanding of using handlebars as a templating engine to dynamically render and format database data for ease interactivity on the front end.
